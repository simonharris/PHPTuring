- PHP Version 5.0 or above
- (To run the test suite) SimpleTest version 1 or above, available from

Should run pretty much out of the box, just unzip into your webspace. To run the
tests you'll need to specify the path to SimpleTest in tests/index.php

Any feedback/queries are most welcome at this early stage. Either contact
pointbeing at users.sourceforge.net, or through the sourceforge project page:

Probably plenty. It would be great to be able to include more example programs
and also compilers for different syntaxes.
